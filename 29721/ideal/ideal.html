            The engine is the heart of the car, converting fuel into motion
            through a series of controlled explosions. Key components include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Cylinders: Where the fuel-air mixture is compressed and ignited
            </li>
            <li>
              Pistons: Move up and down inside the cylinders, driving the
              crankshaft
            </li>
            <li>
              Crankshaft: Converts the up-and-down motion of the pistons into
              rotational motion
            </li>
            <li>
              Valves: Control the intake of fuel and air, and the exhaust of
              combustion gases
            </li>
            <li>
              Spark plugs: Provide the spark to ignite the fuel-air mixture in
              gasoline engines

          <p>
            The transmission system transfers power from the engine to the
            wheels, allowing the vehicle to move at different speeds. There are
            several types:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Manual: Requires the driver to shift gears manually using a clutch
              pedal and gear stick
            </li>
            <li>
              Automatic: Shifts gears automatically based on vehicle speed and
              engine load
            </li>
            <li>
              Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT): Provides seamless
              acceleration without distinct gear shifts
            </li>
            <li>
              Dual-clutch: Combines the efficiency of a manual transmission with
              the convenience of an automatic

        <div class="collapsible">Suspension</div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            The suspension system is designed to maximize the friction between
            the tires and the road surface, providing steering stability and
            good handling while ensuring passenger comfort. Key components
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Springs: Absorb and store energy from road bumps</li>
            <li>
              Shock absorbers: Dissipate the energy stored by the springs,
              preventing excessive bouncing
            </li>
            <li>
              Struts: Combine spring and shock absorber functions in a single
              unit
            </li>
            <li>
              Control arms: Connect the wheel hub and steering knuckle to the
              frame of the vehicle
            </li>
            <li>Anti-roll bars: Reduce body roll during cornering</li>

          <p>
            The braking system is crucial for slowing down and stopping the
            vehicle. Most modern cars use a hydraulic braking system with these
            main components:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Brake pedal: The driver interface to activate the braking system
            </li>
            <li>
              Master cylinder: Converts the force from the brake pedal into
              hydraulic pressure
            </li>
            <li>
              Brake lines: Carry brake fluid to transmit the force from the
              pedal to the wheels
            </li>
            <li>
              Brake calipers: House the brake pads and push them against the
              rotors
            </li>
            <li>Brake pads: Create friction to slow the wheels</li>

        <div class="collapsible">Steering System</div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            The steering system allows the driver to control the direction of
            the vehicle. Modern cars typically use a rack-and-pinion steering
            system, which includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Steering wheel: The driver interface for controlling direction
            </li>
            <li>
              Steering column: Connects the steering wheel to the rack and

            </li>
            <li>
              Rack and pinion: Converts the rotational motion of the steering
              wheel into the linear motion needed to turn the wheels
            </li>
            <li>
              Tie rods: Connect the rack to the steering knuckle on each front
              wheel
            </li>
            <li>
              Power steering system: Assists the driver in turning the wheels,

            The exhaust system is responsible for guiding reaction exhaust gases
            away from the engine combustion chamber. It also reduces harmful
            emissions and engine noise. Main components include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Exhaust manifold: Collects exhaust gases from multiple cylinders

          <li>
            <strong>Fluid Fill:</strong> All necessary fluids (oil, coolant,
            brake fluid, etc.) are added.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Battery Installation:</strong> The battery is installed and
            connected.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quality Control:</strong> The vehicle undergoes a series of
            tests to ensure everything is working correctly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Final Inspection:</strong> A thorough visual inspection is
            performed to catch any defects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Road Test:</strong> The vehicle is driven to ensure it
            performs as expected.

          <h3>Gasoline Engines</h3>
          <p>
            Gasoline engines are the most common type of internal combustion
            engine. They work by igniting a mixture of fuel and air using spark
            plugs. Key features include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Four-stroke cycle: intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust
            </li>
            <li>Spark-ignition system</li>
            <li>
              Generally higher RPM and lower torque compared to diesel engines
            </li>
            <li>Requires more frequent maintenance</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Diesel Engines</h3>
          <p>
            Diesel engines use compression ignition instead of spark plugs. They
            are more efficient but typically produce more emissions.
            Characteristics include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Higher compression ratios</li>
            <li>Self-ignition of the fuel-air mixture due to high pressure</li>
            <li>Generally more fuel-efficient than gasoline engines</li>
            <li>
              Higher torque output, making them suitable for heavy-duty
              applications

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Torque is a measure of rotational force. In automotive context, it
            represents the twisting force that the engine can apply to the
            drivetrain. Key points about torque include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Measured in pound-feet (lb-ft) or Newton-meters (Nm)</li>

            aspects of horsepower include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Calculated using the formula: Horsepower = (Torque × RPM) / 5,252

            <li>
              All-wheel drive (AWD): Power can be sent to all four wheels, often

            </li>
            <li>
              Four-wheel drive (4WD): Similar to AWD, but typically with a

            In automotive terms, efficiency primarily refers to fuel efficiency

            converts fuel or energy into motion. Key points include:
          </p>
          <ul>

            <li>
              For electric vehicles, efficiency is often measured in
